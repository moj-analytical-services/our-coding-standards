# Minimum AQA Standards for code

This page sets out how to implement existing guidance on AQA for for analytical projects which are written primarily as code (i.e. in a programming langauge).  Existing guidance can be found here:

`\\dom1\data\HQ\102PF\Shared\Group_LCDSHD2\Analytical Services\AQA - guidance-forms etc\Tailoring Quality Assurance`

## Existing guidance

Existing guidance provides a framework for categorising your project into nine categories, based on the impact of the analysis and the risks associated with errors.

This guidance sets minimum standards associated with these categories.

## When does this guidance apply?

This guidance applies to work that we deliver to our customers.  You may perform exploratory data analysis for your own use, and commit this code to Github without adhering to these minimum standards.  In this case you should tag the repository as 'exploratory' and make a note of this in your readme.  Create a separate repository for the final analysis that will be delivered to customers, which will then be subject to these minimum standards.
