## Our Coding Standards

This repo contains Analytical Service Directorate's (ASD's) Coding Standards.  

These are split into two sections:

* Prescriptive minimum coding standards for analytical projects, and
* A set of principles for working on code projects in ASD

## Our minimum standards checklist

All projects should meet our proportionate minimum coding standards, which can be found [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/our-coding-standards/web/).

## Our coding principles

The following coding principles have been developed to help achieve the following objectives. (I) Ensure we write high quality, maintainable, code;  (II) Where possible, ensure our work is reusable; and (III) Collaborate with one another effectively accross multiple projects.


**1: Use [the same version control pattern](version_control_pattern.md) across all projects**

**2: [Names have power](naming.md) and purpose, use them wisely**

**3: Code should be [correct, clear and concise](correct_clear_concise.md) - in that order**

**4: Optimise for [change](change_is_inevitable.md)**

**5: Other team members [are users too](they_are_users_too.md) - treat them with respect**

**6: [Share](share_the_knowledge.md) the knowledge**

**7: [Everything fails](error_handling.md) at some point - be ready for it**

**8: Use [sensible defaults](sensible_defaults.md) unless you have a great reason not to**

**9: Analyses should be [simple and easy to reproduce](reproducibility.md) on another machine.**

These ideas are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate. In fact, you are encouraged to contribute. 

All development is a trade-off between competing pressures, these principles are meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.

They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way.


## Further guidance

**1: [Reviewing](reviewing_a_pull_request.md) a pull request**

**2: Manual [quality assurance](quality_assurance.md)**

**3: Writing an amazing [README.md](
README_template.md) for your project**

## Contributing

If you think that something is missing or not quite right you should either:
1. [Contribute directly](version_control_pattern.md)
2. [Raise an issue](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards/issues)
