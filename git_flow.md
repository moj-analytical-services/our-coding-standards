# Git-flow

### Git-Flow is a working practice, for use with any version control system, that helps to:
1. Maintain overall code quality
2. Facilitate collaboration on a single project
3. Protect the codebase

We have tweaked it a little from what is [described on GitHub][1] 

### There are 5 basic steps to our process:
1. Create or clone a repo
2. Create a new branch for the work you're about to do
3. Make some commits on the new branch
4. When you're ready, submit a pull request and wait for peer-review
5. Once peer review is comeplete, and any comments addressed, merge into the master branch using a rebase

The master branch should be 100% functional at all times, on any machine.  Please ensure it is [protected](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/).

If you want to test this out, clone this repo and make a contribution :)
