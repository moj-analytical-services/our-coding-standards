# Our coding standards and working practices
Community-led coding standards and working practices for data science and code-based analytical processes.


### The purpose of this repo

This repo is intended to help us:
1. Write high quality, maintainable, code
2. Collaborate with one another accross multiple projects

We should each try to adhere to these guidelines but you may be able to make a strong case for deviating in some circumstances.


### Contributing to this repo

If you think that something is missing or not quite right you should either:
1. [Raise an issue][1]
2. Contribute directly using the [Git-flow][2] pattern

### 1: Using a common version control pattern accross all projects will reduce the friction associated with switching teams. Let's start with [Git-flow][2]
