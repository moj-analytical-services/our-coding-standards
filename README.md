## The purpose of this repo

These ideas are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate. In fact, you are encouraged to contribute. 
All development is a trade-off between competing pressures, these principles are meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.
They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way.
They are to guide future and current development - use your judgement, but in general only rewrite existing code if you really have to. 

By establishing these ideas as common practice we will:
1. Write high quality, maintainable, code
2. Where possible, ensure our work is reusable
3. Collaborate with one another effectively accross multiple projects

## Our coding standards and working practices

**1: Use [the same version control pattern](verson_control_pattern.md) accross all projects**

**2: [Names have power](naming.md) and purpose, use them wisely**

**3: Code should be [correct, clear and concise](correct_clear_concise.md) - in that order**

**4: Optimise for [change](change_is_inevitable.md)**

**5: Other team members [are users too](they_are_users_too.md) - treat them with respect**

**6: [Share](share_the_knowledge.md) the knowledge**

**7: [Everything fails](error_handling.md) at some point - be ready for it**

**8: Use [sensible defaults](sensible_defaults.md) unless you have a great reason not to**
