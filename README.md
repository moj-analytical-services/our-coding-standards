# Our coding standards and working practices
Community-led coding standards and working practices for data science and code-based analytical processes.


### The purpose of this repo

These ideas below are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate. In fact, you are encouraged to [contribute][3]. 
All development is a trade-off between competing pressures, these principles are meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.
They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way.
They are to guide future and current development - use your judgement, but in general only rewrite existing code if you really have to. 

By establishing these ideas as common practice we will:
1. Write high quality, maintainable, code
2. Collaborate with one another effectively accross multiple projects

### Contributing to this repo

If you think that something is missing or not quite right you should either:
1. [Raise an issue][1]
2. Contribute directly using the [Git-flow][2] pattern

### 1: Using a common version control pattern accross all projects will reduce the friction associated with switching teams. Let's start with [Git-flow][2]
