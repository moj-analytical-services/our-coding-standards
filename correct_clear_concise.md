# Code should be correct, clear, concise - in that order
* Correct means provably correct - with tests. All fixes & new features should include tests to prevent regressions.
* Choose clarity over cleverness - avoid monkey-patching and meta-programming unless you have a very good reason not to.
* Don’t Repeat Yourself - The ‘Rule of Three’ is a good approach to managing duplication. Less code is usually better - but not at the expense of clarity
