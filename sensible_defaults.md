# Use sensible defaults
* Default to packages from the [Tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/), because they have been carefully designed to work together effectively as part of a modern data analysis workflow.  More info can be found here: [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
* If there is a standardised directory structure for your type of project, using it will help people find things.
* Use [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) for R dependencies - it's required by the Analytics Platform and will, therefore, be used on some projects, eventually, anyway.
* If you think of something else we should be doing or using by default, please clone the repo and submit a pull request featuring that addition :)
