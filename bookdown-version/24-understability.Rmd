## Understandability {#understand}

### Use sensible defaults 

There are often many ways of tackling a given problem.  As a team, it makes sense to standardise our approach, not because one approach is necessarily better than all others, but because collaboration is easier if there is less diversity in our approaches.

This section sets out sensible defaults which you are expected to follow.  They are not strict rules, but you will be expected to explain the benefits of alternative approaches if you want to do something different.

#### General {-}
* You should target [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) data structures as part of your work.  You should attempt to convert incoming data into tidy format as quickly as possible, and any data that is output that may be used in other projects should be in tidy format.
* If there is a standardised directory structure for your type of project, using it will help people find things. [TODO: Add examples]

#### R {-}
* Default to packages from the [Tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/), because they have been carefully designed to work together effectively as part of a modern data analysis workflow.  More info can be found here: [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).  For example:
     * Prefer tibbles to data.frames
     * Use ggplot2 rather than base graphics
     * Use the pipe `%>%` appropriately, but not always e.g. see [here](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/603883121197514752).  
     * Prefer `purrr` to the `apply` family of functions.  See [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions) 
* Use [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) for R dependencies - it's required by the Analytical Platform if you need to deploy your work.
* R Packages are the [fundamental unit of reproducable R code.](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) 

#### Python {-}
* Use Python 3
* Use pandas for data analysis
* Use `loc` and `iloc` to write to data frames
* Use Altair for basic data visualisation
* Use Scikit Learn for machine learning
* Use SQLAlchemy and pandas for database interactions, rather than writing your own SQL

#### Encoding and CSVs {-}
Use unicode.  This means you should convert inputs that include non-ASCII characters to unicode as early as possible in your data processing workflow. If you are outputting to text files, these should be encoded in utf-8. Your output csvs should pass [this](https://csvlint.io/) csv linter.

#### SQL {-}
* Use Postgres or SQLite where possible, rather than other SQL database backends.

#### GIS {-}
* Use PostGIS as your GIS backend
* Prefer conducting your GIS analysis in code, e.g. using SQL, rather than point and click in a GUI
* Use QGIS if you need a GUI.

#### Javascript {-}
* Use Vega or Vega-lite for pre-constructed charting
* Use d3.js for custom charting
* Use leaflet.js for mapping.
* Use Bootstrap as a style template
* Use underscore.js for data manipulation

#### Finally {-}
* If you think of something else we should be doing or using by default, please clone the repo and submit a pull request featuring that addition :)

### Separate functions out

### Coding style
#### Apply a linter {-}

#### Names have power and purpose - use them wisely {-}

* Don’t be cute or jokey when naming things.
* Names convey meaning - well-named functions & variables can remove the need for a comment and make life a little easier for other readers, including your future self!
* Avoid meaningless names like ‘obj’ / ‘result’ / ‘foo’.
* Use single-letter variables only where the letter represents a well-known mathematical property (e.g. e = mc^2), or where their meaning is otherwise clear

#### Code should be correct, clear, concise - in that order {-}

* Correct means demonstrably correct - with tests (ideally) and / or documented [Quality Assurance](quality_assurance.md).  Automated tests are ideal because they allow the code to be refactored with confidence.
* All fixes & new features should include tests to prevent regressions (i.e. reappearance of the bug you just fixed).
* Choose clarity over cleverness - use advanced language tricks with care.
* Code should be [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) - which stands for 'Don’t Repeat Yourself'. - The [‘Rule of Three’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)) is a good approach to managing duplication. Less code is usually better - but not at the expense of clarity.  
* To help with clarity and establish patterns within the team, please use either the [PEP8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) style guide (for Python) or [LintR](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) (for R).  The relavant linters will help you with this.
* Ensure that your tests and linters run automatically on all pull requests, if that is possible, by setting up [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) on your repo.  This will probably be more complicated than it is worth if your repo is private due to restrictions that are applied to the free TravisCI accounts.
* Use code comments judiciously:

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?" Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.” - Steve McConnell

#### Everything fails at some point {-}
Accept this and code defensively when calling other services.
Every HTTP call could error or hang - handle failures appropriately and fail fast. Don’t let long-running external calls impact your user experience.
Aim to provide useful information to end users and people working on the code, when something fails.

#### Other team members are users too - treat them with respect {-}
If you have to explain how your code works, then your code is not clear enough.
Be nice to your future self (and assume that they will have forgotten the exact thought process that led to that bit of code you just wrote).
Comments are for explaining why something is needed, not how it works.
Make your commit messages as [informative as possible](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
