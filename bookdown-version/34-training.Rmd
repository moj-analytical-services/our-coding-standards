**POPULATE** fully

There are a number of channels through which coding knowledge is shared in DASD:  

* Slack channels (key channels are: [#data_science][341], [#r][342], [#python][343], [#conda][348])  
* Coffee and Coding (resources [here][344])  
* [DASD training Trello][345]  
* [R learning resources][346]  
* [Online analytical training Trello][347]
