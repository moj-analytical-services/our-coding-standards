## Knowledge Sharing {#knowledge}

### Share the knowledge 
If you have knowledge which is unique to you, it is your responsibility to share it.
We follow “github flow”, to keep branches small and short-lived, and ensure knowledge is shared.
You could also present your work at Display DaSH.
If you produce something reusable, package it & share it with others.
All non-throwaway code should be reviewed - no-one is 100% right, 100% of the time.
Be aware that ‘throwaway’ code has a nasty habit of somehow ending up in completed products.
