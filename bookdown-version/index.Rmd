# Introduction {-#intro}

This document contains the Data and Analytical Service Directorate's (DASD) coding standards.  

## Motivation {#motivation}

The DASD coding standards have been developed to help DASD adopt a unified/consistent approach to writing code, ensuring that our work is high quality, maintainable and reusable and that we are able to collaborate effectively across multiple projects [AMEND].

The purpose of this document is to raise awareness of/hgihlight key coding principles and to briefly explain why we should code in such a way. These coding standards are by no means a list of rules, but seek to provide guidance on how we can achieve 'best practice' in our coding. The more of these you follow, the easier life will be for you and your colleagues. These are open for discussion....

Coding practices should aim to create code that is:  

* Reproducible
  + Measures should be put in place to ensure that code can be run across different machines and over time to produce the same results.  
* Collaborative
  + Projects should be structured in such a way that we can collaborate effectively across multiple projects
  + Code should be structured efficiently so that others can re-use existing code. This ensures consistency in approach and reduces the need for new code to be written and quality assured.  
* Accurate
  + Code should be error free and appropriately quality assured.    
* Understandable
  + Code should be structured, commented and documented to ensure it can be understood easily by others and passed on to others with minimal additional instruction.

## Guidance structure {#structure}

The first part of this document contains the four coding principles, with additional details on the practical actions people should take to achieve these.

There is the recommended workflow for coding projects - this can be used to aid understanding of the steps that should be taken in a project and how the coding principles fit into the project lifecycle.

The final section includes a checklist of actions to be taken to achieve the principles. This is a condensed list of the material covered in the coding principles section.
