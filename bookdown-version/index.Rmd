# Introduction {-#intro}

This document contains the Data and Analytical Service Directorate's (DASD) coding principles. These have been developed to help DASD adopt a standard approach for coding projects, ensuring that our work is high quality, maintainable and reusable and that we are able to collaborate effectively.

These coding principles are by no means a list of rules, but seek to provide guidance on how we can achieve 'best practice' in our coding - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way. These ideas are always open to debate and you are encouraged to contribute to the discussion.

## Document structure {-#structure}

The first part of this document contains the four [coding principles](#principles), with details on the practical actions that can be taken to help us follow the principles.

The second part of the document contains additional resources that may be helpful in understanding how to apply the principles to the project life-cycle. This includes an [example workflow](#wf), a [project checklist](#checklist) and a [knowledge share resource list](#ksresources). 

## Contributing {-#contributing}

If you think that something is missing or not quite right you should either:  
1. [Contribute directly](#versioncontrol)
