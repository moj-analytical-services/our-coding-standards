# Introduction {#intro}

This document contains the Data and Analytical Service Directorate's (DASD) coding standards.  

## Motivation {#motivation}

-- Filler Text --
Within DASD we use coding standards to ensure that all the code we produce is:  
  
* Reproducible 
* Collaborative
* Accurate
* Understandble

Break it down by each section.
High quality: how do adopting CS make the code high quality?
Understandable: how do adopting CS make the code understandable?
Reproducible: how do adopting CS make the code repdocuible?

## Structure {#structure}

The coding standards are split into two sections:

* Prescriptive minimum coding standards for analytical projects, and
* A set of principles for working on code projects in DASD

The minimum coding standards are required for all projects.
The principles have been developed as examples of best practice.



## Further guidance {#guidance}

#**1: [Reviewing](reviewing_a_pull_request.md) a pull request**

#**2: Manual [quality assurance](quality_assurance.md)**

#**3: Writing an amazing [README.md](README_template.md) for your project**
