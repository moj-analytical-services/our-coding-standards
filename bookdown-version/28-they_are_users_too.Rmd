## Code Understandability {#understand}

### Other team members are users too - treat them with respect 
If you have to explain how your code works, then your code is not clear enough.
Be nice to your future self (and assume that they will have forgotten the exact thought process that led to that bit of code you just wrote).
Comments are for explaining why something is needed, not how it works.
Make your commit messages as [informative as possible](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
