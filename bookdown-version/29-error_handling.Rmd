## Handling Errors {#error}
### Everything fails at some point 
Accept this and code defensively when calling other services.
Every HTTP call could error or hang - handle failures appropriately and fail fast. Donâ€™t let long-running external calls impact your user experience.
Aim to provide useful information to end users and people working on the code, when something fails.
