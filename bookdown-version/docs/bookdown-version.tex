\chapter*{Introduction}\label{intro}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

This document contains the Data and Analytical Service Directorate's (DASD) coding principles. These have been developed to help DASD adopt a standard approach for coding projects, ensuring that our work is high quality, maintainable and reusable and that we are able to collaborate effectively.

These coding principles are by no means a list of rules, but seek to provide guidance on how we can achieve `best practice' in our coding - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way. These ideas are always open to debate and you are encouraged to contribute to the discussion.

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\section*{Document structure}\label{structure}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Document structure}

The first part of this document contains the four \protect\hyperlink{principles}{coding principles}, with details on the practical actions that can be taken to help us follow the principles.

The second part of the document contains additional resources that may be helpful in understanding how to apply the principles to the project lifecycle. This includes an \protect\hyperlink{wf}{example workflow}, a \protect\hyperlink{checklist}{project checklist} and a \protect\hyperlink{ksresources}{knowledge share resource list}.

\hypertarget{part-principles}{%
\part{Principles}\label{part-principles}}

\hypertarget{principles}{%
\chapter*{Coding Principles}\label{principles}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Coding Principles}

We want to aim for code that is:

\textbf{1. \protect\hyperlink{understand}{Understandable}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Projects should be \protect\hyperlink{structure2}{structured} with clear logical separation of parameters, assumptions, data and code, with appropriate documentation.\\
\item
  As far as possible, code should follow the \protect\hyperlink{style}{style guidance} outlined.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. \protect\hyperlink{accurate}{Accurate}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Projects should include \protect\hyperlink{unittest}{unit testing}.
\item
  All code should be \protect\hyperlink{review}{reviewed}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. \protect\hyperlink{collaborate}{Collaborative}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Projects should follow the \protect\hyperlink{versioncontrol}{github workflow}.
\item
  Knowledge should be \protect\hyperlink{knowledge}{shared}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. \protect\hyperlink{reproduce}{Reproducible}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{projdep}{Project dependencies} should be managed.
\item
  The \protect\hyperlink{format}{format} of the output should be chosen with reproducibility in mind.
\item
  Projects should be \protect\hyperlink{change}{optimized for change}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{understand}{%
\chapter{Understandable}\label{understand}}

It is crucial that we write code in a way that can be understood easily by others (and our future selves!) and passed on to other staff with minimal additional instruction.

\hypertarget{structure2}{%
\section{Code structure}\label{structure2}}

There should be clear logical separation of parameters, assumptions, data and code, with appropriate documentation.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection*{Data}\label{data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  MOJ data should never be committed to the Github repository - even a `private' repo isn't secure. Instead, data should be stored in an s3 bucket or in Athena. {[}\textbf{POPULATE} with link to ap guidance{]}.
\item
  Small data files that are not MOJ data can be committed to the Github repo (e.g.~parameters, csvs containing assumptions, mock data for unit tests, lookup tables) - these should be stored in a `data' folder within the project folder.{[}\textbf{POPULATE} with link to github with example project structure{]}
\item
  Prefer text format (e.g.~csv) to Excel\\
\item
  It should be easy for others to change parameters and data without needed to understand the full codebase.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{readme}{%
\subsection*{Documentation}\label{readme}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Documentation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Your project should include a README - by writing a README for your project you're helping others (and your future self) to be able to understand and run your project. Find our template README \href{https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards/blob/master/README_template.md}{here}.
\item
  You should add a description to your Github repository and tag it with appropriate tags This will allow your project to be discoverable and reusable by others.
\item
  Any functions you create should have appropriate documentation {[}\textbf{POPULATE} with link to how to do this.{]}
\item
  Your code should be appropriately commented. Comments are for explaining why something is needed, not how it works.
\item
  Try to make your commit messages as informative as possible.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{functions}{%
\subsection*{Abstractions}\label{functions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Abstractions}

Abstractions (e.g.~functions, packages, modules etc.) should be used where possible. This makes code easier to understand, maintain and extend.

If you end up using a piece of code three times, it's probably worth turning it into a function and separating it out into a separate script. For more information on how to write functions, see \href{https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/writing_functions_in_r}{here}. As a general rule, functions should be less than about 50 lines long.

All non trivial functions are documented using the programming language's accepted standard:\\
* For Python follow \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP8} and particularly \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/}{PEP257}.\\
* For R, use \texttt{roxygen2}.
If your functions are short and well documented, there is often little need for additional code comments.
{[}\textbf{AMEND} - check links here?{]}

\hypertarget{style}{%
\section{Code style}\label{style}}

There are often many ways of tackling a given problem. As a team, it makes sense to standardise our approach, not because one approach is necessarily better than all others, but because collaboration is easier if there is less diversity in our approaches.

\hypertarget{defaults}{%
\subsection*{Defaults}\label{defaults}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Defaults}

This section sets out sensible defaults which you are expected to follow. They are not strict rules, but you will be expected to explain the benefits of alternative approaches if you want to do something different.

{[}\textbf{AMEND} - check accuracy of these suggestions - are they still in date?{]}

  Follow \href{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html}{Hadley's Style Guide}
\item
  Default to packages from the \href{http://tidyverse.org/}{Tidyverse}, because they have been carefully designed to work together effectively as part of a modern data analysis workflow. More info can be found here: \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz}{R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham}. For example:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Prefer tibbles to data.frames
  \item
    Use ggplot2 rather than base graphics
  \item
    Use the pipe \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%} appropriately, but not always e.g.~see \href{https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/603883121197514752}{here}.
  \item
    Prefer \texttt{purrr} to the \texttt{apply} family of functions. See \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html\#the-map-functions}{here}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use the package name when calling a function. For example, using dplyr::mutate() rather than just mutate()

Use unicode. This means you should convert inputs that include non-ASCII characters to unicode as early as possible in your data processing workflow. If you are outputting to text files, these should be encoded in utf-8. Your output csvs should pass \href{https://csvlint.io/}{this} csv linter.\strut
\end{minipage}\tabularnewline
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.27\columnwidth}\raggedright

In addition to the above coding defaults, the following actions will help you to write understandable code.

\hypertarget{names}{%
\subsection*{Naming conventions}\label{names}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Naming conventions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't be cute or jokey when naming things.
\item
  Names convey meaning - well-named functions \& variables can remove the need for a comment and make life a little easier for other readers, including your future self!
\item
  Avoid meaningless names like `obj' / `result' / `foo'.
\item
  Use single-letter variables only where the letter represents a well-known mathematical property (e.g.~e = mc\^{}2), or where their meaning is otherwise clear
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ccc}{%
\subsection*{Clear and concise code}\label{ccc}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Clear and concise code}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose clarity over cleverness - use advanced language tricks with care.
\item
  Code should be \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\%27t_repeat_yourself}{DRY} - which stands for `Don't Repeat Yourself'. - The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)}{`Rule of Three'} is a good approach to managing duplication. Less code is usually better - but not at the expense of clarity. {[}\textbf{AMEND} - remove? populate links?{]}
\item
  Ensure that your tests and linters run automatically on all pull requests, if that is possible, by \ldots{[}\textbf{POPULATE}{]}
\item
  Use code comments judiciously:
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, ``How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?'' Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.'' - Steve McConnell
\end{quote}

Comments are for explaining why something is needed, not how it works. Appropriate use of comments means it is easier to understand how code works at a later date. Before commenting, consider whether the comment fits better into the function's documentation than in a comment.

\hypertarget{linter}{%
\subsection*{Linters}\label{linter}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Linters}

Apply a linter to easily review your code formatting. This means our coding style will be consistent across projects. It will also make it easier for others to understand our code.

In RStudio, the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+shift+A' will reformat your code and automate some of the process of passing the linter. If you apply the linter as you work, rather than at the end, you will find it much easier to write code that passes the linter first time.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For R use \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lintr/readme/README.html}{Lintr} and follow \href{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html}{Hadley's Style Guide}\\
\item
  For Python, use {[}pylint{]} and follow {[}PEP8{]} \textbf{POPULATE} links
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{errors}{%
\subsection*{Error messages}\label{errors}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Error messages}

Errors will occur, so code defensively when calling other services.
For example, every HTTP call could error or hang - handle failures appropriately and fail fast. Don't let long-running external calls impact your user experience. Aim to provide useful information to end users and people working on the code when something fails.

\hypertarget{accurate}{%
\chapter{Accurate}\label{accurate}}

Code should be error free and appropriately quality assured. Alongside simple sense-checking, two of the key mechanisms for ensuring that code is accurate are unit testing and project review.

\hypertarget{unittest}{%
\section{Unit testing}\label{unittest}}

Testing our code helps to ensure that it is both correct and robust. For further guidance on what you should test, see the \href{https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/coffee-and-coding-public/tree/master/2019-12-06\%20Testing\%20as\%20part\%20of\%20an\%20Analytical\%20Project}{Coffee and Coding `Testing' session}. {[}\textbf{AMEND} - do we need to expand this section beyond unit testing?{]}

As a broad description, unit tests should exist to check that your actual results match your expected results.

{[}\textbf{AMEND}{]} What exactly are we expecting people to test?

Unit tests should test, as a minimum, any functions you create. The purpose of these granular tests is to ensure the code continues to give the correct answer in a range of cases, and even in edge cases (where unusual inputs are provided).

{[}\textbf{AMEND} - this is no longer current{]}
You should ensure that your tests and linters run automatically on all pull requests, if that is possible, by setting up \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{TravisCI} on your repo. This will probably be more complicated than it is worth if your repo is private due to restrictions that are applied to the free TravisCI accounts

There are a number of tools to enable unit testing.

\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{review}{%
\section{Project review}\label{review}}

Code review provides additional assurance that code logic is correct, and also the review should provide comments on code and problem structuring. For smaller projects, the review only needs to be a simple read-through and sanity check.

Code reviews should be initiated through the creation of a \protect\hyperlink{flow}{pull request}. The review should typically involve the reviewer pulling the code to their local machine, testing it, and leaving comments in the pull request.

Remember that it's always easier (for both you and your reviewers) if you commit and push your changes regularly.You should merge branches into master regularly so that reviewers review little and often, rather than attempting to review your entire codebase all at once.

\hypertarget{performing-good-peer-review}{%
\subsection*{Performing good peer review}\label{performing-good-peer-review}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Performing good peer review}

When you review someone's pull request you become the gatekeeper to the master branch - this is a \emph{very} important job! If you're tasked with this and you're wondering how to proceed asking yourself these questions is a good place to start:

1: Do I understand what the code is doing? \protect\hyperlink{ccc}{Did it need to be explained} to me? \protect\hyperlink{ccc}{Could it be simpler}?

2: Are they using \protect\hyperlink{defaults}{packages / libraries sensibly}?

3: Does it need to be \protect\hyperlink{unittest}{tested} (and is it tested with sufficient coverage)?

4: \protect\hyperlink{ccc}{Does it work}? Does it work on my machine?(\#projdep)

5: Are there edge cases that might \protect\hyperlink{unittest}{break} it?

\textbf{AMEND} - update and merge with \protect\hyperlink{defaults}{section above}
* Ensure that your tests and linters run automatically on all pull requests, if that is possible, by setting up \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{TravisCI} on your repo. This will probably be more complicated than it is worth if your repo is private due to restrictions that are applied to the free TravisCI accounts

If you're reviewing the code of a more experienced coder, this is \textbf{a chance to learn} and you have \emph{every} right to ask for an explanation if there's something that is unclear. It's in everyone's interest that you understand what you're reading and it could well be that you don't yet understand it because the author has made a mistake or overcomplicated something. So \emph{don't hold back}.

If you're on the receiving end of feedback, from anyone at all, this is\ldots{} \textbf{a chance to learn!}

\hypertarget{collaborate}{%
\chapter{Collaborative}\label{collaborate}}

It is vital that we're able to collaborate across projects, to share both workload and expertise, and that this collaboration can occur both simultaneously and over time.

A key tool in enabling collaboration is Github, which can be used for sharing code. Checking the code into Github is part of the version control workflow.

\hypertarget{versioncontrol}{%
\section{Version Control}\label{versioncontrol}}

Code should be version controlled using Git and checked into Github.
You can find a guide to using Git with R \href{http://happygitwithr.com/}{here}

Within DASD we follow Github-Flow for our projects. Further information and guidance can be found here. {[}\textbf{POPULATE} with a link?{]}

\hypertarget{flow}{%
\subsection*{Github-Flow}\label{flow}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Github-Flow}

Github-Flow is a working practice that helps to:
1. Maintain overall code quality\\
2. Facilitate collaboration on a single project\\
3. Protect the codebase

We have tweaked it a little from what is \href{https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/}{described on GitHub}

{[}\textbf{AMEND} - check that this is all up-tp-date and correct. Update links where needed.{]}

Make sure that you reference the issue in your pull request, by using the hash (\#) symbol - see \href{https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/}{here} for further guidance. This makes it easy in future to see what changes were made to the code in response to the issue.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item
  To make further changes, just make more commits on the same branch and push them to the remote repo again.
\item
  Once peer review is complete, and any comments addressed, merge into the master branch using a \href{https://github.com/blog/2243-rebase-and-merge-pull-requests}{rebase}.
\item
  The version of master on Github is now ahead of the version of master on your local machine. Bring your local version up to date using \texttt{git\ checkout\ master}, \texttt{git\ pull}. You are now in sync with Github, and ready to start a new branch.
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{master branch should be 100\% functional at all times}, on any machine. Please ensure it is \href{https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/}{protected} and that your tests and / or linters run automatically on all pull requests {[}\textbf{POPULATE} with linnk to automating tests and linters{]}. A protected master branch guarantees that all pull requests have been reviewed before they are merged.

For some further reading we strongly suggest reading this \href{https://gist.github.com/blackfalcon/8428401}{article} that explains these git commands and others in a bit more detail.

We also collaborate through sharing knowledge. If you produce something reusable, please package it and share it with others.

There are a number of channels through which coding knowledge is shared in DASD:\\
* Slack channels (key channels are: \href{https://app.slack.com/client/T1PU1AP6D/C1Z8Q18LS}{\#data\_science}, \href{https://app.slack.com/client/T1PU1AP6D/C1PUCG719}{\#r}, \href{https://app.slack.com/client/T1PU1AP6D/C1Q09V86S}{\#python})\\

\hypertarget{reproduce}{%
\chapter{Reproducible}\label{reproduce}}

We want our code to be reproducible so that: it can be used by others (both for collaboration and to allow effective review and accountability); it keeps working over time (protected from external changes); and so that it can be easily reused by others in their own projects (\textbf{AMEND} - delete this last one?).

There are a number of steps that we can take to ensure that our code is as reproducible as possible.

\hypertarget{projdep}{%
\section{Manage project dependencies}\label{projdep}}

Your project will depend on an number of external factors, such as software or packages. These dependencies may mean that your project won't work on others' machines or may not work on your machine at a later date (e.g.~as external packages are updated over time). To ensure that this doesn't become an issue for your project, you should use some kind of dependency management tool.

\hypertarget{githash}{%
\subsection*{Include a git hash}\label{githash}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Include a git hash}

{[}\textbf{AMEND} - is this still relevant/current?{]}

If practical, the output of your code should include the git hash of the code that produced it. By doing so, the analysis should be
more reproducible, there is no ambiguity about the specific code that was used to generate it.

\hypertarget{r}{%
\subsubsection*{R}\label{r}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R}

You can access the git hash using either of the following code:
snippets.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(git2r)}
\NormalTok{repo <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{repository}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"."}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{repository_head}\NormalTok{(repo))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{system}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"git rev-parse --short HEAD"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{intern =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{python}{%
\subsubsection*{Python}\label{python}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Python}

You can access the git hash using the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ subprocess}
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ get_git_revision_hash():}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ subprocess.check_output([}\StringTok{'git'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'rev-parse'}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{'HEAD'}\NormalTok{])}
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ get_git_revision_short_hash():}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{format}{%
\section{Format}\label{format}}

If the output is a report, the write up should be fully reproducible, or as close as possible.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Avoid workflows that require manually copying and pasting results between documents.\\
\item
  For Python, consider using Jupyter notebooks. For R, use \texttt{rmarkdown}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{change}{%
\section{Optimize for change}\label{change}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't try to solve every conceivable problem up-front, instead focus on making your code easy to change when needed.
\item
  Don't prematurely optimize - choose clarity over performance, unless there is a serious performance issue that needs to be addressed.
\item
  Change can come in several forms, including hardware - your code will eventually be run on a colleague's machine or a server somewhere. Without overcomplicating things, write your code with this in mind. For example, use relative paths (e.g.~\texttt{./file\_in\_the\_project\_directory.R} rather than \texttt{/Users/my\_username/development/my\_project/file\_in\_the\_project\_directory.R})
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Workflow}\label{wf}}

The following is the recommended workflow for coding projects in DASD. It has been included here to aid understanding of how the coding principles fit into the project lifecycle.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Create/clone \protect\hyperlink{versioncontrol}{github repo}}\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  By storing your code in a repo you're making it easier for others to collaborate on your project, to use pieces of your code elsewhere and ensures that your project will be accessible in the future.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Create \protect\hyperlink{versioncontrol}{issue}}\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using issues to communicate what you're working on helps to coordinate tasks between team members and creates a record of completed work, useful for quality assurance purposes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Create \protect\hyperlink{versioncontrol}{branch}}\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Creating a branch means that several people can work on a project simultaneously and protects the main codebase from any unwanted changes.\\
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Set up \protect\hyperlink{projdep}{dependency management}}\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Managing your project dependencies means that your project is more likely to be rerunnable in the future and on others' machine.\\
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Build in \protect\hyperlink{unittest}{unit testing}}\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Unit tests provide confidence that your code is correct and can be used to pinpoint issues where they occur, making fixes quicker and easier.\\
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Commit \protect\hyperlink{versioncontrol}{changes}}\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Commiting your changes means that you can recover your work if you make a mistake and provides a record of changes for your reviewer.\\
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{review}{Pull request and code review}}\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ensuring that your code is reviewed provides confidence in the accuracy of your code and the opportunity to share knowledge with colleagues.
\end{itemize}
