# Understandable {#understand}

It is crucial that we write code in a way that can be understood easily by others (and our future selves!) and passed on to other staff with minimal additional instruction.


## Code structure {#structure2}
There should be clear logical separation of parameters, assumptions, data and code, with appropriate documentation.  

### Data {-}

* MOJ data should never be committed to the Github repository - even a 'private' repo isn't secure. Instead, data should be stored in an s3 bucket or in Athena. [**POPULATE** with link to ap guidance].  

* Small data files that are not MOJ data can be committed to the Github repo (e.g. parameters, csvs containing assumptions, mock data for unit tests, lookup tables) - these should be stored in a 'data' folder within the project folder.[**POPULATE** with link to github with example project structure]  

* Prefer text format (e.g. csv) to Excel  
* It should be easy for others to change parameters and data without needed to understand the full codebase.  

### Documentation {-#readme}

* Your project should include a README - by writing a README for your project you're helping others (and your future self) to be able to understand and run your project. Find our template README [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards/blob/master/README_template.md).  

* You should add a description to your Github repository and tag it with appropriate tags This will allow your project to be discoverable and reusable by others.  

* Any functions you create should have appropriate documentation [**POPULATE** with link to how to do this.] 

* Your code should be appropriately commented. Comments are for explaining why something is needed, not how it works. 

* Try to make your commit messages as informative as possible.

### Abstractions {-#functions}

Abstractions (e.g. functions, packages, modules etc.) should be used where possible. This makes code easier to understand, maintain and extend.

If you end up using a piece of code three times, it's probably worth turning it into a function and separating it out into a separate script. For more information on how to write functions, see [here][13]. As a general rule, functions should be less than about 50 lines long. 

All non trivial functions are documented using the programming language’s accepted standard:  
* For Python follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and particularly [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).  
* For R, use `roxygen2`.
If your functions are short and well documented, there is often little need for additional code comments.

## Code style {#style}


There are often many ways of tackling a given problem.  As a team, it makes sense to standardise our approach, not because one approach is necessarily better than all others, but because collaboration is easier if there is less diversity in our approaches. 

### Defaults {-#defaults}

This section sets out sensible defaults which you are expected to follow.  They are not strict rules, but you will be expected to explain the benefits of alternative approaches if you want to do something different.

[**AMEND** - check accuracy of these suggestions - are they still in date?]


+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Language                | Defaults                                                      | 
+=========================+===============================================================+
| R                       | * Follow [Hadley's Style Guide][14]   |
|                         | * Default to packages from the [Tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/), because they have been carefully designed to work together effectively as part of a modern data analysis workflow.  More info can be found here: [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz).  For example:   |
|                         |   * Prefer tibbles to data.frames   |
|                         |   * Use ggplot2 rather than base graphics   |
|                         |    * Use the pipe `%>%` appropriately, but not always e.g. see [here](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/603883121197514752).    |
|                         |     * Prefer `purrr` to the `apply` family of functions.  See [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions)   |
|                         |  * Use the package name when calling a function. For example, using dplyr::mutate() rather than just mutate()   |
|                         | * R Packages are the [fundamental unit of reproducable R code.](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)   |
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Python                  |  * Follow [PEP8]  
|                         |  * Use Python 3                                               |
|                         |  * Use pandas for data analysis                               |
|                         |  * Use `loc` and `iloc` to write to data frames               |
|                         | * Use Altair for basic data visualisation    |
|                         | * Use Scikit Learn for machine learning |
|                         | * Use SQLAlchemy and pandas for database interactions, rather than writing your own SQL |
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Encoding and CSVs       | Use unicode.  This means you should convert inputs that include non-ASCII characters to unicode as early as possible in your data processing workflow. If you are outputting to text files, these should be encoded in utf-8. Your output csvs should pass [this](https://csvlint.io/) csv linter.                 | 
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| SQL                     | Use Postgres or SQLite where possible, rather than other SQL database backends.        | 
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| GIS                     | * Use PostGIS as your GIS backend |
|                         | * Prefer conducting your GIS analysis in code, e.g. using SQL, rather than point and click in a GUI |
|                         | * Use QGIS if you need a GUI.       | 
+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+


In addition to the above coding defaults, the following actions will help you to write understandable code.

### Naming conventions {-#names}

* Don’t be cute or jokey when naming things.
* Names convey meaning - well-named functions & variables can remove the need for a comment and make life a little easier for other readers, including your future self!
* Avoid meaningless names like ‘obj’ / ‘result’ / ‘foo’.
* Use single-letter variables only where the letter represents a well-known mathematical property (e.g. e = mc^2), or where their meaning is otherwise clear


### Clear and concise code {-#ccc}

* Choose clarity over cleverness - use advanced language tricks with care.
* Code should be [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) - which stands for 'Don’t Repeat Yourself'. - The [‘Rule of Three’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)) is a good approach to managing duplication. Less code is usually better - but not at the expense of clarity.  [**AMEND** - remove? populate links?]
* Ensure that your tests and linters run automatically on all pull requests, if that is possible, by ...[**POPULATE**]
* Use code comments judiciously:

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?" Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.” - Steve McConnell

Comments are for explaining why something is needed, not how it works. Appropriate use of comments means it is easier to understand how code works at a later date.  Before commenting, consider whether the comment fits better into the function’s documentation than in a comment.

### Linters {-#linter}
Apply a linter to easily review your code formatting. This means our coding style will be consistent across projects. It will also make it easier for others to understand our code.

In RStudio, the keyboard shortcut 'ctrl+shift+A' will reformat your code and automate some of the process of passing the linter. If you apply the linter as you work, rather than at the end, you will find it much easier to write code that passes the linter first time.

* For R use [Lintr][12] and follow [Hadley's Style Guide][14]  
* For Python, use [pylint] and follow [PEP8] **POPULATE** links

### Error messages {-#errors}
Errors will occur, so code defensively when calling other services.
For example, every HTTP call could error or hang - handle failures appropriately and fail fast. Don’t let long-running external calls impact your user experience. Aim to provide useful information to end users and people working on the code when something fails.
