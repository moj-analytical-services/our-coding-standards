# Coding Principles {#principles}

The following coding principles have been developed to help achieve the following objectives. (I) Ensure we write high quality, maintainable, code;  (II) Where possible, ensure our work is reusable; and (III) Collaborate with one another effectively accross multiple projects.

Code should be:

**1. Reproducible**  

* Optimise for [change](#change)  
* Analyses should be [simple and easy to reproduce](#reproduce) on another machine.

**2. Collaborative**  

* Use [the same version control pattern](#versioncontrol) across all projects  
* [Share](#knowledge) the knowledge  

**3. Accurate**  

* QA section  

**4. Understandable**  

* [Names have power](#names) and purpose, use them wisely  
* Code should be [correct, clear and concise](#ccc) - in that order  
* Other team members [are users too](#understand) - treat them with respect  
* [Everything fails](#error) at some point - be ready for it  
* Use [sensible defaults](#defaults) unless you have a great reason not to  


These ideas are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate. In fact, you are encouraged to contribute. 

All development is a trade-off between competing pressures, these principles are meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.

They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way.
