# Coding Principles {#principles}

The following coding principles have been developed to help achieve the following objectives. (I) Ensure we write high quality, maintainable, code;  (II) Where possible, ensure our work is reusable; and (III) Collaborate with one another effectively accross multiple projects.

Code should be:

**1. [Reproducible](#reproduce)**  

* Manage [project dependencies](#projdep)
* Optimise for [change](#change)  
* Analyses should be [simple and easy to reproduce](#githash) on another machine.

**2. [Collaborative](#collaborate)**  

* Use the [github workflow](#versioncontrol) across all projects  
* [Share](#knowledge) the knowledge  

**3. [Accurate](#accurate)**  

* Ensure code is [reviewed](#review)
* Complete [unit testing](#unittest)

**4. [Understandable](#understand)**  

* Use [sensible defaults](#defaults) unless you have a great reason not to
* Write [functions](#functions) where needed  
* [Stylistic](#style):  
  - Apply a [linter](#linter)
  - Ensure [variable names](#names) are meaningful 
  - Code should be [correct, clear and concise](#ccc) 
  - [Handle errors](#errors)  
  - Other team members [are users too](#users) - treat them with respect  
  

These ideas are stated in no particular order, and are *always* open to debate. In fact, you are encouraged to contribute. 

All development is a trade-off between competing pressures, these principles are meant to help you decide which trade-offs are acceptable.

They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way.
