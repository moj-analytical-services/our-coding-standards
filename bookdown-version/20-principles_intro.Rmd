# (PART) Principles {-}

# Coding Principles {-#principles}

The coding principles have been designed to help DASD adopt a unified/consistent approach to writing code, ensuring that our work is high quality, maintainable and reusable and that we are able to collaborate effectively across multiple projects [AMEND].

Note that the specific actions recommended within this document, although grouped under each of the four principles, do overlap between the principles - they have been placed where they were deemed to fit best.

They are guidance, not The Law - there will always be edge cases, but you should expect to be challenged if you go your own way.

Code should be:

**2. [Accurate](#accurate)**  

* Ensure code is [reviewed](#review)
* Complete [unit testing](#unittest)


**3. [Collaborative](#collaborate)**  

* Use the [github workflow](#versioncontrol) across all projects

**4. [Reproducible](#reproduce)**
