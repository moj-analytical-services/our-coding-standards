High quality: how do adopting CS make the code high quality? Understandable: how do adopting CS make the code understandable? Reproducible: how do adopting CS make the code repdocuible? 1.2 Structure The coding standards are split into two sections: Prescriptive minimum coding standards for analytical projects, and A set of principles for working on code projects in DASD The minimum coding standards are required for all projects. The principles have been developed as examples of best practice. 1.3 Further guidance #1: Reviewing a pull request #2: Manual quality assurance #3: Writing an amazing README.md for your project 1.4 Contributing If you think that something is missing or not quite right you should either: 1.
