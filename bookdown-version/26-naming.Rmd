## Names {#names}

### Names have power and purpose - use them wisely

* Don’t be cute or jokey when naming things.
* Names convey meaning - well-named functions & variables can remove the need for a comment and make life a little easier for other readers, including your future self!
* Avoid meaningless names like ‘obj’ / ‘result’ / ‘foo’.
* Use single-letter variables only where the letter represents a well-known mathematical property (e.g. e = mc^2), or where their meaning is otherwise clear
