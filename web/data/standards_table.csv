Code Structure,,,,,3,,,
"Clear separation of parameters, data, and code using a standard directory structure.",1,5,"This separates your logic (your code) from the data, assumptions and parameters that power your work. It should be easy for others to change parameters and data without needing to understand the full codebase.",,1,,,
Code should pass relevant linter.,1,2,This means our coding style will be consistent across projects.  It will also make it easier for others to understand our code.,,1,,,
Code must pass relevant linter.,3,5,This means our coding style will be consistent across projects.  It will also make it easier for others to understand our code.,,1,,,
"Appropriate use of abstractions like functions, packages, modules etc, which has been reviewed by language expert. Generally, most code should be factored out into functions or other abstractions, and functions should be less than about 50 lines long.",1,5,"Makes code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.",,1,"For Python, you should factor code out into modules.","For R, you should use packages as fundamental units of code.","In javascript, you should generally be using multiple `.js` files.  For visualisation code, there should be a separation of concerns between the data model, and the code that visualises your data. "
"If using a notebook for write up, functions are factored out to maintain narrative.",2,5,This makes your logic easier to follow,,1,"For Python, code should be factored out into modules.","For R, factor out code either into a `source()`ed `.R` file or a package",
Reproducibility,,,,,3,,,
"If the output is a report, the write up is fully reproducible, or as close as possible.  Avoid workflows that require manually copying and pasting results between documents. ",1,5,"If we need to review or update the output at a later date, we know how we came to earlier results.",,1,"For Python, consider using Jupyter notebooks.","For R, use `rmarkdown`",
Development workflow,,,,,3,,,
Code is version controlled using Git and checked into Github,1,5,Your work is transparent and discoverable by others and there's a 'single version of the truth' for code.,,1,,,
The project is developed using 'Git flow'.,3,5,"You are able to maintain a continuously quality controlled 'master' version of the code, whilst also being able to test new featurs and functionality",,1,,,
"The 'Master' branch is protected, and contained only QAed code",4,5,A protected master branch guarantees that all pull requests have been reviewed before they are merged.,,1,,,
"All code has been subject to code review.  For smaller projects, this is a simple read-through and sanity check",1,2,"Code review provides additional assurance that code logic is correct, and also the review should provide comments on code and problem structuring.",,1,,,
"All code has been subject to code review.  This process has been managed through pull requests, and this evidenced in Github.  This should typically involve the reviewer pulling the code to their local machine, testing it, and leaving comments in the pull request.  ",3,5,"Code review provides additional assurance that code logic is correct, and also the review should provide comments on code and problem structuring.",,1,,,
Documentation,,,,,3,,,
You have added a description to your Github repository and tagged it with appropriate tags,1,5,This will allow your project to be discoverable and reusable by others.,,1,,,
"A README.md file exists in the repository, which contains standard fields ",1,5,This will allow your project to be discoverable and reusable by others.,,1,,,
"Code is appropriately commented. [Comments are for explaining why something is needed, not how it works.](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards/blob/7e751164d577b521e7f62484a68ee1861f8ae4ac/they_are_users_too.md#L4)",1,5,Appropriate use of comments means it is easier to understand how code works at a later date.,,1,,,
All non trivial functions are documented using the programming language's accepted standard.,3,5,,,1,"For Python, refer to PEP8 and write correctly formatted docstrings","For R, use `roxygen2` to document your functions.",
Unit testing,,,,,3,,,
"Unit tests exist that test the overall codebase, but not individual functions.",1,2,Unit tests help give you confidence that your model does what you think it does,,1,,,
"Unit tests exist at the function level, which test a range of parameters.  The purpose of these granular tests is to ensure the code continues to give the correct answer even in ‘edge cases’ (where unusual inputs are provided).",3,5,,,1,,,"For data vis in Javascript, you need unit tests of routines that manipulate your data or data structures.  Visual checks are sufficient of visualisation outputs, but you must make visual checks of the output against real data, and some test datasets that produce predictable output (e.g. where values are set to 1, 0.5 etc.)"
You should have reached code coverage of at least 75%,2,5,"Higher code coverage means that more routes through you code have been checked. Low code coverage is a bad sign, high code coverage is not necessarily a good thing.",,1,,,
Dependency Management,,,,,3,,,
Your project should be tested on someone else's machine,1,2,There may be software or other dependencies installed on your machine that mean the project doesn't work on others' machines.,,1,,,
"Dependency management using Packrat, Pip freeze, or equivalent.",3,5,"If your code depends on external packages, these change over time, and need to be enumerated. This guarantees that your code will work on others' machines, and that it will work on your machine in a year's time.",,1,,,
Language specific,,,,,3,,,
You must follow PEP8,1,5,,Python,1,,,
Use a VirtualEnv,1,5,,Python,1,,,
Use Hadley's code style guide,1,5,,R,1,,,
"In R, you should generally use a functional programming style.",1,5,,R,1,,,
